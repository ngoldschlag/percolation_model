This python file executes an agent-based percolation model that extends the percolation framework in Silverberg and Verspagen 2007. The model incorporates patents which can: 1) provide additional resources to innovators to invest in R&D and 2) block other firms from exploring the technology space.

To execute the model submit via console passing the desired simulation test as a parameter, e.g. "python test1a", below is a list of valid simulation test names. 
['test1a', 'test1b', 'test2a', 'test2b', 'test3a', 'test3b', 'test4a', 'test4b', 'typical']

ABSTRACT: A model of the innovation process is proposed as a method of understanding the effects of patents in both promoting and stifling innovative search. Traditional static economic models of the innovation process and patenting struggle to capture the interdependence of different types of technologies and the path dependence of innovative search. This research addresses this gap by proposing an agent-based computational model that directly incorporates path dependence, localized search, uncertainty, and the interdependence of technological innovations. The model is capable of replicating several empirical observations including the skewed distribution of innovation value as well as the temporal clustering of radical innovations. Simulation results are used to investigate how patent breadth, patent duration, and monopoly power affect the performance of innovative search. The results suggest that monopoly power in varying degree can substitute for patent protection. Patents can improve innovative performance when firms have less monopoly power and the technology space is difficult to navigate. However, when the technology space is less difficult to navigate innovative performance significantly improves without patents. Likewise, when the technology space is simple increased patent strength, breadth, and duration, stifle innovative search.
